## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.
It requires pandas, matplotlib, numpy and collections libraries.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Bachelors vs Higher Educational Titles — Since you are a bachelor, does it worth to get higher education titles (like master and doctor) to make more money?
2. How to Unstuck — What are the best techniques when developers find themselves stucking on a problem?
3. Meditation vs Satisfaction — Does meditation practices improve the life/career satisfaction?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  
The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased above.  
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

There are 2 .csv and 1 .pdf files:
1. survey_results_public.csv - CSV file with main survey results, one respondent per row and one column per answer
2. survey_results_schema.csv - CSV file with survey schema, i.e., the questions that correspond to each column name
3. so_survey_2020.pdf - PDF file of survey instrument
